Code-Break: Fun site for programmers to take a break from frustrating code!

* Oh no the user's code is broken! User is on the brink of tears and needs something to make them laugh. They want to be able to click a button and see a joke.

* The joke is intriguing and the stage is set, but the user doesn't want to think too hard when their brain is already code jelly. They want to  click a button and be restored by the punchline. Lets Give them life again...

* The user is beginning to feel their spirits lift, but its going to take more than that. Let's give them a creative outlet to vent all their programming frustrations. We could give them a boring chat forum, but a meme is worth a million likes.

* Now that they've gotten that off of their chest the user is feeling much better and almost ready to get back to work, almost. The user wants needs a final boost of laughs. Let's give them gif gallery of programming funnies.

* The user is in stitches. Spirits lifted, and life's essence restored the user found just they boost they needed by taking a code-break! But one more thing, the user might need to return one day, and would like like to see some variety. Let's add a user LogIn capability and a search bar to the gifs gallery so that the user can find new gifs. Remember, some may need more than others so lets let them pick how many.
